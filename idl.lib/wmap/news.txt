The following changes to the WMAP software distribution have been implemented
since V1.0

16-Aug-2006: Release of V2.0

             Added TOD_TO_SKY_COORDS - New procedure to extract a time series
	     of coordinates from an array of time-ordered data records

             Added FITS_READ_COMBINED_MAP - New procedure to read a combined
             temperature/polarization map as delivered by the WMAP team to
             LAMBDA.

	     Modified FITS_READ_TOD - This procedure, which reads the time-ordered
             data FITS files, has been modified to read a one channel TOD FITS
             file (as released in the first WMAP data release; this was the original
             behaviour of this procedure), a two channel TOD file (as provided
             in calibrated TOD data of the second WMAP data release), and a four
             channel TOD file (as provided in the uncalibrated TOD data of the
             second WMAP data release).

23-Jul-2004: Release of V1.3

22-Jul-2004: HEALPIX_TO_IMAGE - Fixed incorrect call to STDDEV()

08-Jul-2004: INTERPOLATE_QUATERNIONS - New procedure to interpolate quaternions
             extracted from WMAP time-ordered data

             MAPVIEW - Now contains a widget entry field for a HEALPIX FITS 
	     file name, i.e. one no longer needs to specify the FILENAME or
	     ARRAY keywords.   Also, data I/O has been made more efficient
	     
	   
28-Jul-2003: Release of V1.2

18-Jul-2003: FITS_REPROJ_HEALPIX - Convert a HealPix image to a flatmap FITS
		   file with world coordinate system (WCS) information

18-Jul-2003: MAPVIEW - Added PNG file output, fixed bug with ring maps

23-May-2003: SCAN_OVERLAY, GRID_OVERLAY - Work on Windows devices
             Software now available in a .zip file for Windows users

20-May-2003: HEALPIX_NESTED_VECTORS, LOAD_MAP_PARAMS, SCAN_OVERLAY, PLANET_OVERLAY 
             GET_HEAL_LUT, GET_PRT_TEMP - updated to use CONCAT_DIR to 
	     concatenate directories on non-Unix systems

18-Apr-2003: MAPVIEW - Now has ARRAY keyword to read from an array instead of
               a file 

16-Apr-2003: FITS_READ_MAP - Close open file unit, new keyword PHeader to
                   return the primary header

19-Mar-2003: Release of V1.1

17-Mar-2003: HEALPIX_TO_IMAGE (called by MAPVIEW) modified to avoid negative
                logarithms when logarithmic scaling is specified

06-Mar-2003: QUAT_TO_SKY_COORDS -- Modified to use the mean optical axis if the
              DA_STR parameter is not supplied

14-Feb-2003:

    HealPix V1.2 (released 10-Feb) introduced two incompatibilities in the
    MAPVIEW program.
    
    (1) EULER_MATRIX no longer works, but instead instructs users to use
        EULER_MATRIX_NEW (with a different sign convention)
    (2) DATA2GNOM has a different calling sequence, and calls a new routine
        VECTOR_MAP
    
    MAPVIEW was modified to call EULER_MATRIX_NEW (with the new sign convention)
    and the Healpix 1.2 version of DATA2GNOM was renamed to WMAP_DATA2GNOM.   
    Copies of EULER_MATRIX_NEW, VECTOR_MAP and WMAP_DATA2GNOM are then included
    in the WMAP distribution to provide compatibility for users with HealPix 
    V1.1.

  Updated wmap_idl_installation.txt to indicate that procedures to add to the
!PATh are located in /home/user/wmap/pro not /home/user/wmap.   Introduce the
(much smaller) tar file wmap_IDLpro_v11.tar containing only the procedure
library plus any updated reference files.


12-Feb-2003: New procedure SCAN_OVERLAY to plot WMAP's scan path using 
     quaternion data.     SCAN_OVERLAY calls the new procedures 
     Q2M -  Convert quaternions to rotation matrices
     QUAT_TO_SKY_COORDS - Extract coordinates from input quaternions
     
    FITS binary table map_los.fits added to the $MAP_REF directory

    FITS_READ_MAP modified to not read the number of observations column 
                  unless requested  
    
    New "WIDGETS" category added to the list_of_routines to match the 
    Explanatory Supplement.     File updated with new procedures.
    
    Tar file renamed to wmap_IDL_v11.tar.gz

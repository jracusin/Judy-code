This directory contains 57 FITS files giving the lookup tables for converting
from a HEALPIX image to a flatmap projection.    Each lookup table differs
depending on the coordinate transformation (between Galactic, celestial and
ecliptic), the projection (Mollweide or zenithal equal area (zea)), or the size
of the image (1, small 512 x 256, 2 medium 1024 x 512, 3 Large 2048 x 1024, 
4 X large 4096 x 2048, and 5 XX large 8192 x 4096). 

These FITS files are stored as gzip compressed files to save disk space, but
this somewhat slows the processing speed, as the programs must decompress on the
fly.    The user is welcome to decompress the files in this directory to
improve the processing speed 

These files are read by the program GET_HEAL_LUT, while the program
REPROJ_HEALPIX actually performs the mapping.

This directory contains device-independent (XDR) IDL savesets, giving
information about resistance data.    Currently contains 2 files:

1. prt_splinedata.xdr - Contains B-spline coefficients for interpolating the
conversion between ohms and temperature for PRTs (Platinum resistance
Thermometer).   Used by GET_PRT_TEMP.PRO

2. deu_internal_temps_lut.xdr - Contains a lookup table to convert from
internal temperature counts to degrees C in the DEU (digitial electronics
unit).  Called by GET_DEU_INT_TEMP

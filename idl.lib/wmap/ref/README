MAP_REF

This is the base directory of MAP_REF, containing reference files used by the
WMAP IDL software.

The main directory contains two files: 

1. programs.pars - an ASCII file giving parameters of the MAP orbit and
   other characteristics.    This file is read by the program Load_MAP_Params
2. map_los.fits - a FITS binary table describing the line-of-sight for each
   microwave horn in spacecraft coordinates.


The MAP_REF directory contains following subdirectories

/luts - Contains lookup tables, in particular for converting between HealPix
        coordinates and a flat map projection
/pixels - Contains FITS files for converting HealPix pixels of Cartesian [X,Y,Z]
          direction vectors
/planet_overlay - Contains the JPL DE405 ephemeris as a FITS files
/prt_data - Contains device-independent (XDR) IDL savesets, giving
            information about resistance data.

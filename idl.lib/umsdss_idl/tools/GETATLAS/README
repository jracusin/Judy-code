	get_atlas.pro is an IDL procedure that loads atlas images.  It 
calls an  external C routine.  This is a modified version of a stand alone 
atlas reader written by Robert Lupton.  

; EXAMPLES:
;   Look at the atlas images in each bandpass for first 10 objects in frame 35
;   of run 109
;
; IDL> file='/sdss3/data4/run109/tsObj-000109-3-0-0011.fit'
; IDL> read_photo_col, file, struct, struct_type='all', start=35, nframes=1
; IDL> index = indgen(10)
; IDL> get_atlas, struct, index
;
;   Save the r' band atlas image with no display or prompting.  If clr is 
;   specified, then only that image is retrieved and the program runs faster.
;
; IDL> get_atlas, struct, 33, clr=2, /noprompt, /nodisplay, imr=red_image
; 


The C code is made into a .so file: call_atlas.so.  You will need this file
to run get_atlas.pro. The full path to this file is set on about line 92
of get_atlas.

This code has been written to be complete so some of the code may be useless
for many purposes.  In particular the displaying routine has been written
to be user friendly but it may not have use for those just saving a bunch of
images.  However, most of the extra stuff can be turned off with 
the appropriate keywords.  

Note: in order to save memory, the code only saves the last image looked at.
It can be easily modified to save all the images specified by 'index' or
it can be called in succession without too much overhead.

get_atlas currently has 5 subroutines:

atlas_name.pro
combine_atlas.pro
copy_atlas.pro
missing_atlas.pro
display_atlas.pro

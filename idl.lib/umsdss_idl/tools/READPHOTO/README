The proc read_photo_col reads in a 'column' of objects from an Sloan
tsObj file.  A column consists of the data for all five colors in 
a column of ccd's.  There are 6 columns of ccd's on the camera.

The column is stored in a series of what I will call 'frames.'  
A frame is the same size as a 'field.'  However, field zero is the 
first picture  taken in the run which may not have been saved.  
Frame zero is the first _saved_ field.  The field, run, and camcol 
are are not phototags, rather they are stored in the header of each 
frame.  read_photo_col puts these numbers in the output tags automatically.

; Examples:
;
;  Read in a whole column of data and store it in struct.  run 109, camcol 3
;
; IDL> file='/sdss3/data4/run109/tsObj-000109-3-0-0011.fit'
; IDL> read_photo_col, file, struct
;
;  Read in a few frames beginning with frame 33
;
; IDL> read_photo_col, file, struct, start=33, nframes=20


read_photo_col has the following subroutines:

make_default_tags.pro
make_tags.pro
make_struct.pro
tag_type.pro


Notes:
The procedure make_default_tags makes a default set of tags
to be read from the tsObj file.  This can be altered to 
read in the tags you want or you can input a list as a keyword

	taglist=taglist

If any new tags are added to the photo output catalogs, then 
tag_type.pro, which checks if the input tags are good, will have to 
be altered.

For more details, see the header of the appropriate routines.

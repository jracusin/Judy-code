These routines are designed to make cuts on SDSS photo catalog based
on flags.

First, make a flag structure:

IDL>make_flag_struct, fs

each flag is set to 'D' for don't care.  i.e. don't care about that flag.
If you want a flag to be false, set the flag to 'N'.  If you require
the flag to be true, set the flag to 'Y'.

IDL>fs.CHILD = 'Y'

Then you can select by these flags.  This example selects on 
regular flags, color 2 (red).  s will store the good indices.

IDL>colorindex=2
IDL>flag_select, photostruct, fs, colorindex, s

This will select on only objc_flags:

IDL>flag_select, photostruct, fs, colorindex, s, objc=1
